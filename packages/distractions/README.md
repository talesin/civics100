# Distractions Package

A TypeScript-based distractor generation engine for civics questions, built with Effect-TS functional programming patterns. Creates comprehensive pools of plausible but incorrect answer choices for US Citizenship Test questions.

## Overview

The distractions package generates high-quality "distractor" answers (incorrect but plausible choices) for civics questions, enhancing the difficulty and educational value of practice tests. Rather than using random incorrect answers, it provides contextually relevant alternatives that effectively test knowledge.

### Core Concepts

- **Distractors** - Plausible but incorrect answer choices that challenge understanding
- **Static Pools** - Curated collections of related incorrect answers (e.g., non-federal holidays, incorrect historical figures)
- **Question Classification** - Automatic categorization of questions for appropriate distractor selection
- **Quality Assessment** - Validation of distractor relevance and educational value

## Features

### Distractor Generation Strategies

#### Static Pool Generation
For questions where distractors can be drawn from well-defined categories:

- **Branches of Government** - Legislative, Executive, Judicial mix-ups
- **Geography** - US states, territories, capitals, rivers, oceans
- **Government Positions** - Cabinet roles, constitutional offices
- **Historical Elements** - Presidents, Vice Presidents, wars, documents
- **Political Representatives** - Senators, Representatives from other states
- **Rights & Freedoms** - Bill of Rights and constitutional principles
- **State Information** - Capitals, governors from other states

#### Curated Distractor Database
Carefully selected incorrect answers that are:
- **Contextually Relevant** - Related to the correct answer domain
- **Educationally Valuable** - Test genuine understanding vs. memorization
- **Appropriately Challenging** - Neither too obvious nor impossibly obscure

### Technical Features

- **Effect-TS Architecture** - Functional programming with composable services
- **CLI Interface** - Simple command for generating distractor pools
- **Quality Metrics** - Assessment of distractor effectiveness
- **Similarity Analysis** - Prevent distractors that are too similar to correct answers
- **Integration Ready** - Designed for use by downstream quiz applications

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm 8+
- TypeScript 5+
- Access to civics2json question data

## Installation

The package is part of the civics100 monorepo workspace:

```bash
# From the monorepo root
npm install

# Or install workspace dependencies
npm install --workspace=distractions
```

## Usage

### CLI Generation

Generate distractors for all civics questions:

```bash
# Generate question-distractor pairs
npx tsx src/cli/index.ts

# This will create data/questions-with-distractors.json
```

The CLI will:
1. Load questions from the `civics2json` package
2. Classify each question by type and content
3. Generate appropriate distractors using static pools
4. Assess distractor quality and relevance
5. Output enhanced questions with distractor pools

### Programmatic API

Use the distractor services in other applications:

```typescript
import { Effect } from 'effect'
import { 
  DistractorManager, 
  CuratedDistractorService, 
  StaticGenerator 
} from 'distractions'

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const manager = yield* DistractorManager
  const curatedService = yield* CuratedDistractorService
  
  // Generate distractors for all questions
  yield* manager.generateAndWrite()
  
  // Or generate for specific question types
  const historyDistractors = yield* curatedService.generateDistractors(
    'history', 
    3  // number of distractors
  )
  
  return historyDistractors
})

// Run with service dependencies
await Effect.runPromise(
  Effect.provide(program, [
    DistractorManager.Default,
    CuratedDistractorService.Default,
    StaticGenerator.Default
  ])
)
```

## Architecture

### Service Architecture

The package follows Effect-TS service patterns with dependency injection:

#### DistractorManager
Main orchestration service:
- `generateAndWrite()` - Complete distractor generation pipeline
- Coordinates between question loading and distractor generation
- Handles file I/O and output formatting

#### CuratedDistractorService  
Core distractor generation logic:
- `generateDistractors(category, count)` - Generate distractors by category
- `assessDistractorQuality()` - Evaluate distractor effectiveness
- `classifyQuestion()` - Determine appropriate distractor strategies

#### StaticGenerator
Static pool-based distractor creation:
- `generate()` - Process all questions with static distractors
- Integration with curated distractor pools
- Question classification and pool selection

#### Supporting Services
- **QuestionClassifierService** - Categorize questions by content type
- **PoolMappingService** - Map question types to distractor pools

## Distractor Strategies

### Static Pool Categories

#### Geography Distractors
For questions about US geography:
- **States**: Other US states for state-specific questions
- **Capitals**: State capitals from other states  
- **Rivers**: Major US rivers (Mississippi, Colorado, etc.)
- **Oceans**: Bodies of water bordering the US

#### Government Distractors
For questions about government structure:
- **Cabinet Positions**: Secretary roles and departments
- **Constitutional Offices**: President, Vice President, Speaker, etc.
- **Branches**: Legislative, Executive, Judicial concepts

#### Historical Distractors
For questions about US history:
- **Presidents**: Historical presidents for presidential questions
- **Vice Presidents**: Historical VPs for VP questions
- **Wars**: Major US conflicts and military actions
- **Documents**: Important historical documents

### Quality Metrics

Distractors are evaluated on:

- **Relevance** - Contextually related to the correct answer
- **Plausibility** - Believable for someone with partial knowledge
- **Educational Value** - Tests genuine understanding vs. guessing
- **Difficulty Balance** - Neither too obvious nor impossibly hard

### Example Output

```json
{
  "question": "What is the supreme law of the land?",
  "correctAnswer": "the Constitution",
  "distractors": [
    "the Declaration of Independence",
    "the Bill of Rights", 
    "the Articles of Confederation"
  ]
}
```

## Configuration

### Distractor Pool Configuration

Customize static pools by editing files in `src/data/pools/`:

```typescript
// src/data/pools/geography.ts
export const GEOGRAPHY_DISTRACTORS = {
  states: ['California', 'Texas', 'Florida', /* ... */],
  capitals: ['Sacramento', 'Austin', 'Tallahassee', /* ... */],
  rivers: ['Mississippi River', 'Colorado River', /* ... */]
}
```

### Quality Thresholds

Adjust distractor quality requirements:

```typescript
// Quality thresholds for distractor acceptance
const QUALITY_THRESHOLDS = {
  relevance: 0.7,      // Minimum contextual relevance
  plausibility: 0.6,   // Minimum believability
  educational: 0.8,    // Minimum educational value
  overall: 0.7         // Minimum composite score
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Missing Question Data**:
```bash
# Ensure civics2json data is available
cd ../civics2json
npx tsx src/index.ts questions construct

# Return to distractions
cd ../distractions
npx tsx src/cli/index.ts
```

**Empty Distractor Pools**:
- Check static pool files in `src/data/pools/`
- Verify question classification logic
- Review quality threshold settings

**Build Errors**:
```bash
# Clean and reinstall
npm run clean
npm install
npm run build
```

### Output Validation

Verify generated distractors:

```bash
# Check output file
cat data/questions-with-distractors.json | jq '.[] | select(.distractors | length < 3)'

# Validate distractor quality
npm test -- DistractorQualityService.test.ts
```
